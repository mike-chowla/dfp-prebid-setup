# Line Item Tool for Prebid, OpenWrap, and GAM

This Python-based line item generator for [Prebid.js](http://prebid.org/), [OpenWrap](https://community.pubmatic.com/display/OP/OpenWrap), and [Google Ad Manager](https://admanager.google.com/home/), automates setup for new header bidding partners.

> **Note:** Doubleclick for Publishers (DFP) is now called, Google Ad Manager (GAM). If this repository refers to DFP, consider it equal to, GAM.

When your ad ops team sets up Prebid/OpenWrap, they often must create hundreds of line items in GAM. Using this tool, your team can now define the settings for:

* Advertiser.
* Placements or ad units.
* Prebid/OpenWrap.

The Line Item Tool then uses those definitions to:

* Create an order with one line item per price level.
* Attach creatives.
* Set placement and/or ad units.
* Set Prebid/OpenWrap key-value targeting.

> **Note:** While this tool covers typical use cases, it may not fit your needs. Review the [Limitations](#limitations) before you begin.

## Get started

You'll need the following to use the Line Item Tool:

* Python version >= 3.6 and a basic knowledge of Python.
* Access to create a service account in the Google Developers Console.
* Admin access to your Google Ad Manager account.

### Create Google Ad Manager credentials

The Line Item Tool requires valid GAM credentials to access your  account. The steps below summarize the steps from the [GAM docs](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/docs/authentication) and the Google Ads Python libary [auth guide](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-python-lib).

1.  If you haven't done so already, sign up for a [GAM account](https://admanager.google.com/).
2.  Create Google developer credentials:
    *   Go to the [Google Developers Console Credentials page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
    *   On the **Credentials** page, select **Create credentials**, then select **Service account key**.
    *   Select **New service account**, then select _JSON_ key type. You can leave the _role_ blank.
    *   Use **Create** to download a file containing a `.json` private key.
3.  Turn on API access to GAM:
    *   Sign into your [GAM account](https://admanager.google.com/)—_you must have admin rights_.
    *   In the **Admin** section, select **Global settings.**
    *   Turn on **API access** if it isn't already enabled.
    *   Press the **Add a service account user** button.
        *   Use the service account email for the Google developer credentials you created in step 2.
        *   Set the role to, _Administrator_.
        *   Select **Save**.

### Set up the tool

#### Line Item Tool Prerequisites:

*   Python version 3.6 or higher.
*   Python command line package installer, `pip`.

#### Use the following steps to set up the tool:

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install Python dependencies by running:
    > `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Rename key:
    *   Rename the Google credentials key you downloaded in step 2 above (`[something].json`), to `key.json`.
    *   Now move it to the root of this repository.
4.  Make a copy of `googleads.example.yaml` and rename it, `googleads.yaml`.
5.  In `googleads.yaml`, set these required fields:
    *   `application_name` - the Google project you named while creating GAM credentials above. It should appear in the top-left of the [credentials page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
    *   `network_code` - your GAM network number. For example, in `https://admanager.google.com/12398712#delivery`, the network code is `12398712`.

#### Verifying set up

To test your set up, from the top-level directory run:

> `python -m dfp.get_orders`

If successful, it returns all the orders in your GAM account.

## Create Line Items for OpenWrap

1. Change the following mandatory settings in `settings.py`:

|**Setting**|**Description**|**Type**|
|:----------|:--------------|:-------|
|`DFP_ORDER_NAME`|The name of your new GAM order.|string|
|`DFP_USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS`|The email of the GAM user acting as trafficker for the new order.|string|
|`DFP_ADVERTISER_NAME`|The name of the GAM advertiser for the new order.|string|
|`DFP_TARGETED_PLACEMENT_NAMES`|The names of GAM placements targeted by the line items. Use empty array for, **Run of Network**.|array of strings|

|`PREBID_BIDDER_CODE`|The value of [`pwtpid`](https://github.com/PubMatic/OpenWrap#wrapper-keys-sent-to-dfp) for this partner. Set to `None` to generate line items for all partners. Use array of strings if the line should match multiple partners.|string or array of strings|
|`OPENWRAP_CREATIVE_TYPE`|Which type of creative to use.  Options are `WEB`, `WEB_SAFEFRAME`, `AMP`, `IN_APP`, `NATIVE`, `VIDEO`, `JWPLAYER`.|string|

2. Then, from the root of the repository, run:
    > `python -m tasks.add_new_openwrap_partner`
3. Review your order, line items, and creatives for correctness.
4. Finally, approve the order in GAM.

> **Note:** GAM may warn, "Needs creatives," on the order for ~15 minutes after order creation. This warning is usually incorrect and disappears on its own.

|`DFP_CREATE_ADVERTISER_IF_DOES_NOT_EXIST`|Determines whether to create an advertiser with `DFP_ADVERTISER_NAME` in GAM if one does not exist.|bool|`False`|

## Limitations

*   Line Item Tool does not change existing orders or line items, it only creates them. If you need to make a change to an order, it's easiest to archive the existing order and recreate it. But you can add new line items in the existing order using the setting DFP_USE_EXISTING_ORDER_IF_EXISTS. See [Extra Settings](#extra) above.
